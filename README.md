video-based Person Re-Identification algorithm on SINGLE CAMERA 

(To detect a person with their facial and body features by using cascade classifier on personal webcam) 

Created on JupyterLab (Python 3 ipykernel) by Anaconda Navigator. So the code might throw errors if viewed in PyCharm.

I decided to use my personal laptop web camera to detect person since this is my first video based classification. Where, I have worked with Medical mnist dataset to classify them and predict the accuracy of the right amount of images using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The Code is uploaded in my profile.

To reason out why Cascade and not FairMOT/DeepSORT is that since HAAR CASCADE Classifier has the pretrained data features which is available as open source and also easy to reuse. 

To a beigginer like me in this AI Machine Learning and Computer Vission field, Even though the code might seem unchallenging but I was only able to run this successfully after by working for nearly 6 to 7 hours straight without giving up and tried running codes as many times as possible and also by rearranging the logics. Through this I was able to learn much more than I expected and that is why my interests and eagerness towards AI and Data Analytics are growing deeper than Before.

I tested the results with my family members since it is person re-identification and I was able to achieve the successful detection even when they were in motion.
